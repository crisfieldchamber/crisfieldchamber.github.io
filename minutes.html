<!--

<p>The Crisfield Chamber of Commerce Board of Directors held its monthly meeting on <strong>Thursday, October 30, 2014</strong> at the Chamber Office. The meeting was called to order by President, Billy Drewer.</p>
<p><strong>Present:</strong> Billy Drewer, Tommy Shores, Bruce Wooster, Virginia Townsend, Linda Wilmer, Tillie Doyle, Pat Carson, Sue Heath, Bill Buttrill, John Tawes, Val Howard, Lou Ann Brown and Steve Flaherty.</p>
<p><strong>Absent:</strong> Steve Marshall, Mary Taylor, and Jayna Grant</p>
<p>The minutes from the previous meeting were approved unanimously with a motion by Bill Buttrill and a second by Bruce Wooster. The minutes from the Executive Board Meetings held on September 30, 2014 and October 21, 2014 were also approved unanimously with a motion from Pat Carson and a second from Bill Buttrill.</p>
<p><strong>Financial Report:</strong> Currently there is $328.95 in the general checking account. Checks were written for a total of $1835.12. $2000.00 was transferred from the Clam and Crab Bake Account to the general to cover the checks that were written leaving a balance of $493.83. There is $14811.53 in the Crab Derby Account. There is an outstanding bill for Pepsi that needs to be written for $2069.85 leaving a balance of $12,741.68 in that account. The Clam Bake account had a balance of $33,636.84 before the $2000.00 transfer to the general account. This leaves a balance of $21,626.84 in that account. In the past, all money from the Clam Bake and Crab Derby accounts has been transferred to the general account. Val will transfer money from both accounts leaving a balance of $2000.00 in each for start-up next year. The average expense to run the Chamber office is approximately $3000.00/month. Pat moved with Virginia seconding to approve the Financial Report. Motion passed unanimously.</p>
<p><strong>Office Summary:</strong> The Candidate Forum went well. Bill Buttrill did a wonderful job opening the event and timing the candidates&#39 responses.</p>
<p>The Business After Hours at the Crocket House was poorly attended.</p>
<p>McTavish Market will be held on Saturday, November 15th. We still need vendors. We only have 7 so far.</p>
<p>Maryland Economic Development Meeting is currently being held at Chesapeake Crabhouse.</p>
<p>We want to thank Jayna Grant for a successful Halloween Parade. There were approximately 180 children in attendance. A good time was had by all.</p>
<p>The Elks Club is having a benefit for all cancers and scholarships. There will be a crab feast followed by a dance with a band. Crabs will be served starting at 6pm with the band playing at 8. The Elks is also doing a Christmas Variety Show. Admission will be a wrapped toy.</p>
<p>The Christmas Parade will be held on Friday, December 5th. Tea with Mrs. Claus will be on December 6th .</p>
<p>H&amp;R Block has 3 desks to be given away. If you want one, contact the office.</p>
<p>The next general membership luncheon should be on December 11th. The last one was poorly attended. Suggestion was made to make it a 5pm meeting and serve appetizers. Possible location suggested was McCready Foundation. Further discussion will be held at the November meeting.</p>
<p>The annual banquet will be held on January 17th. Price per person is $20.</p>
<p><strong>Old Business:</strong> Nominating Committee will be Tilliie Doyle, Bruce Wooster, and Virginia Townsend plus 2 members from the general membership. Billy will get those 2 names for next meeting.</p>
<p>Proposed Budget: A copy is attached. The overall income is down $23,000.00 from last year with the total being $70,900.00. Suggestions to increase revenue include possibility of raising ticket prices for Clam Bake to $45/ person or $40/person with purchase of a tent. Executive Board voted to reduce Valerie&#39s salary by $5755 to $22,745.00 by closing the Chamber Office 4 hours/day from November &ndash; February. Valerie spoke to the Board regarding the reduction. She stated she had given up the $2000.00 IRA several years ago. She currently has 3 weeks vacation and 5 sick days. When health insurance was purchased originally, the Chamber opted not to pay for a drug inclusion. Instead there is a $2500.00 allotment for the cost of her prescriptions. Valerie stated she would not request reimbursement for prescriptions so the $2500.00 could be added back into her salary. This would allow her to work 28 hours/wk for 17 weeks at $13.71/hour. (Or she could take a reduced hourly wage at $12.14 which would allow her to work full-time). Valerie has agreed to this adjustment to her salary. A copy of the duties that Valerie currently performs was presented. Billy noted that there are some duties being performed by Val that should be transferred to Board Members occupying positions such as Treasurer and Secretary. We also need a Finance Committee as outlined by the By-Laws. Bruce Wooster, Steve Flaherty and Tommy volunteered. Bruce said he would be willing to do all the posting and writing of checks. This would also allow Val to accomplish her assigned work load without having to work overtime.</p>
<p>Steve and Linda state we need to revamp our events to increase the income.</p>
<p>Bill Buttrill stated the line item on the budget to the Heritage Foundation needs to be eliminated. We need to meet with the Foundation members to eliminate the agreement. Valerie stated the Rhodes Scholar Events still brings in money for the Foundation on a regular basis. Bill moved with Bruce seconding the approve the budget as amended. Motion passed unanimously.</p>
<p>There being no further business, the meeting was adjourned.</p>
<p>Respectfully Submitted,</p>
<p>Susan Heath, Secretary.</p>
